#Instructions: how to run a code


#To run a client(Frontend) folder, (i used VS Code editor) Where you can run a command npm i (to work all dependencies & code) then run a command npm start


#To run a server (backend )folder, use the same command first: npm i and then run command nodemon index (to see in the console wether server  and mongodb were connected successfully ) but you have to setup your own mongDB account in order the code to work properly. To do that
you Just need to create a file called .env and save a mongoDB code link in it (i used .env file to protect my db account privacy).
